    Container object that allows to run extra requirements on checks. These
    additional requirements will be run at most once per check and will
    occur in no guarenteed order.

    Requirements can be added by passing them into the constructor or
    by calling the ``add`` method. They can be removed from this object
    by calling the ``remove`` method. To check if a requirement has been added
    to the current conext, you may call ``is_added`` or use ``in``::

        some_req in additional
        additional.is_added(some)req)

    Additional objects can be iterated and length checked::

        additional = Additional(some_req)
        assert len(additional) == 1
        assert list(additional) == [some_req]

    Additional objects may be combined and compared to each other with the following
    operators:

    ``+`` creates a new additional object by combining two others, the new
    additional supplies all requirements that both parents did.

    ``+=`` similar to ``+`` except it is an inplace update.

    ``-`` creates a new additional instance by removing any requirements from
    the first instance that are contained in the second instance.

    ``-=`` similar to ``-`` except it is an inplace update.

    ``==`` compares two additional instances and returns true if both have
    the same added requirements.

    ``!=`` similar to ``!=`` except returns true if both have different
    requirements contained in them.
